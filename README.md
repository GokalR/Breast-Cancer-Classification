The dataset was obtained from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

In this project, we compared algorithms using training accuracy and AUC scores. The Gradient Boosting classifier and Random Forest classifier showed better results than the others.
